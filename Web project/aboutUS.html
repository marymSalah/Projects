<h2>Making of</h2>
<p>When the assignment was posted, and the group were divided. We decided on a time and place to discuss and brainstorm ideas. 
During that process we came up with a lot of ideas that we deemed robust and strong when it came to educational website. That was our first hurdle,
 we clashed in deciding ideas as we are three people with different creative opinions, we overcame that shortly when we finally decided on one. Bahrain Tours,
 an educational website about the historic activities in the Kingdom of Bahrain. Moreover, we decided on a theme, colors, and font sizes. 
 That was when we faced our second hurdle, CSS didn’t provide all the fonts we had chosen, and we had to come with a compromise.</p>
 
 <p>Later, after sketching the ideas, we had another meeting to work on the homepage collaboratively. 
 We had an issue with translating our sketched idea onto the webpage because of slight image proportions.
 However, after extensive research we managed to fix it. Moreover, during the creation of a webpage,
 the laptop crashed on one of the members and we had to start from scratch. Luckily the information was fresh and 
 we were able to recover successfully. When the rough sketch of the homepage was completed (without the form) the team divided the 
 work between the three of us, it was easier to divide as there was three subtopics and the other pages we would work on together.
 On the other hand, another issue we faced was our different schedules, along with exams being in the way we had a hard time meeting with each other.
 After we were done with the home page, we decided to add the form in the home page itself. We had problems figuring out where the form fits in the actual webpage; 
 we redesigned the webpage and put the form fit in it.</p>
 <p>During the implementation of the webpages, all three of us were focused on the creative aspects of the design. A lot of thought and effort went into making the web-page user friendly and accessible.
 When researching, ideas are infinite. That left us with very little time to write the theory report. Choosing the design wasn’t the hardest part, it was translating it to words that took the most time.
 Moreover, our biggest challenge was that when we came to combine all our webpages, we struggled severely with the CSS because of clashes within class and ID names. It took a long time to comb through all
 the webpages and ensure that they all look as coordinated as possible. The lesson learnt from this experience was that it was vital to agree on the standard shape and class/ID naming prior to starting,
 while also making sure that unique classes in each webpage do not have the same name so they don’t clash. </p>
 
 <p>To conclude, throughout this journey of building this website, we have gained a lot of skills. Those include that user friendly interfaces are very important; they are the key to the website’s success. 
 Images and font sizes must be appropriate and clear to the user. In addition, the CSS should be calculated thoroughly in prior, and comments should be added to make sure that the full team understands. 
 We believe that this website development helped us find out what could possibly go around and worked on various problem-solving techniques within a group that will ensure these mistakes never happen again.</p>
<h2>Developers Report</h2>
<p>
We made our site promote the historic tour around Bahrain by effectively showcasing relevant photos and videos alongside information that 
is very educational towards our topic. We also made ourselves available for contact if there are any questions or suggestions. In addition,
 the activities that are listed in our website are available for the users<br> to experience. Moreover, we provided information about the most popular
 and most interesting activities of History of Bahrain, that will make the people who are visiting learn more about the country and their culture.  </p>

<p>The three main activities we wanted to showcase were Pottery, Pearl Diving and Agriculture, all of them have the same structure flow, explaining
the history of the activity along with media showcasing it, furthermore all the 3 webpages have the components used to help facilitate the activity, 
such as plucking dates for agriculture, diving material for pearl diving and materials used to make pottery in the Pottery page. Moreover, it was decided
that all those components would be viewed in the website as a photo that displays information when hovered over. All the webpages have a the same 
background as well as an old paper background for the body, to give a histroic feel. The font colors were chosed to provide the same feel as well, 
along with a serif font because it fits the feel we were trying to achieve  </p>
<p>What we think will make the users come back to our site and reuse it, is that the fonts are very clear, it doesn’t require them to work hard to
 be able to read the text.In addition to that, the colors used are not hard to look at for a long time, colors used are very neutral and soothing 
 to the eye.  Moreover, the information in the website will be constantly updated.  Also, we have a newsletter option where users can register and 
 receive weekly newsletters about the updates in the website and changes in the activities. </p>

 <p>In case anyone other than us decided to maintain the website, it would be pretty easy for them to do so, as our code has comments for nearly every 
line of code provided, which really simplifies the process of them figuring out what each line of the code does and makes their job easier. 
In addition to that, the naming of the divisions and media are pretty clear and straightforward which makes you know for which part is each division. 
Also, we made sure our CSS is in the right flow, where it starts from the heading and continuing till it reaches to the footer. each line of code is in
 the same place it is in the html file itself, for example, the footer is at the end of the CSS file as it is at the end of the website. All the developers
 are aware of the names of the divisions, pictures and videos, for instance everyone in the developers team is aware of the name ‘main3’ and what it means.
 Therefore, our code is easy to modify and maintain.  </p>


 <p>There are 3 main web accessibility standards that we tried to maintain and showcase within our webpage. We tried to ensure that our web pages are perceivable.
 The user on the other end can clearly make out a clear idea of the website without the help of plugins, the content is clearly visible and they are able to 
 navigate and maneuver very easily, all the links lead to the right places. Moreover, all media including images and videos have text alternatives to make 
 sure that low internet connectivity does not affect our functionality. 

Secondly we took high regards in making our website understandable, the content is structured in a very easy way to process. In addition, the sentences are
 not complex, they are grammatically and punctually correct and they use very basic vocabulary

Finally, we want to make sure that the website is robust, with relevant multimedia and multimedia sharing and a collection of sites to visit and numbers to contact. </p>
